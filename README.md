## React Fundamental Concepts Used:

In the "Gadget Heaven" project, several React fundamental concepts are employed, including:

**Components:** 
The entire project is built using React components, such as NavBar, Banner, GadgetDetail, Wishlist, and Dashboard.

**Props:** 
Components receive data and functions through props, allowing for data flow and functionality sharing between components.

**State:** 
State is used to manage data within components, such as cart and wishlist items.

**Lifecycle Methods:** 
Hooks like useEffect are used to perform side effects, such as fetching data and updating local storage.

**Routing:** 
React Router is used for navigation, enabling SPA (Single Page Application) functionality with components like NavLink, useLocation, and useParams.

## Data Handling and Management:

In this project, data is handled and managed primarily through:

**Context API:** 
The Context API can be used for managing global state, although it is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippets. This allows for a consistent state across different parts of the application.

**Local Storage:**
 Local storage is extensively used to store cart and wishlist items. This ensures that data persists across page reloads and sessions.

## Key Features:

Here are five notable features of the "Gadget Heaven" project:

**Product Details Page:** 
Displays detailed information about each product, including image, title, description, price, specifications, and rating. Users can add items to the cart or wishlist from this page.

**Cart Management:**
Users can add items to their cart, view the cart's contents, remove items, and sort the cart by price. The total cost is dynamically updated.

**Wishlist Management:**
 Users can add items to their wishlist and view or remove them at any time. This allows for a separate collection of favorite items.

**Responsive Design:**
 The website adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

**Toast Notifications:**
 User actions, such as adding items to the cart or wishlist and removing items, trigger toast notifications for instant feedback.
